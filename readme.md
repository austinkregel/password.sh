# What is this?
This will be a collection of scripts to cryptographically generate random passwords. Each script should accept only 1 parameter which is the length of the password desired.

# How do I contribute?
Simple fork this repo, create a merge request with your script, and wait for it to be merged or denied.

Please note that there will only be 1 script per language (for now). If you want to build a script for an existing language, please modify the script in your fork and submit a pull request.

# How do I use?
_These scripts (thus far) are designed for *nix systems, so windows machines cannot use these at the moment._

`~$ sh password.sh 32`

`~$ php password.php 32`

`~$ python password.py 32` 

ect...

## Assistance
If you need help with a script please file an issue, and remember to make sure you're using the proper script for the programs you have installed..

ie. Don't use the PHP script if you don't have PHP installed on your computer.
